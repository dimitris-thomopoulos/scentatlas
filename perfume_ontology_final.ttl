About the brand:
Avon brand began as The California Perfume Company in 1886, when the Union Publishing House changed both its name and the focus of its business from publishing to perfumes and cosmetics. It was a pioneer in creating career opportunities for women at a time when most women did not work outside the home or were limited to clerical and domestic work. The first products to bear an Avon brand name were launched in 1928. The California Perfume Company filed for its first "Avon" trademark on a beauty product in 1932, and officially changed its name to Avon in 1939. It has produced over 900 perfumes. The earliest edition was created in 1934 and the newest is from 2020.""" ;
